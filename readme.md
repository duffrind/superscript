# SuperScript

SuperScript is a dialog system + bot engine for creating human-like conversation chat bots. It exposes an expressive script for crafting dialogue and features text-expansion using wordnet and Information Retreaval and extraction using ConceptNet. 

## What comes in the box
* Dialog Engine
* Multi-User Platform for easy intergration with Group Chat systems
* Message Pipeline with POS Tagging, Sentence Analysys and Question Tagging
* Extensible Plugin Architecture

## How it works

The message pipeline contains many steps, and varies from other implemetations.

When input comes into the system we convert the input into a message object. The message object contains multiple purmatuations of the origional object and has been analyzed for parts of speach and question classification. The message is first handled by the reasoning system, before being sent to the dialog engine for processing.

## Install

    npm install superscript

## Examples

    + I like fish
    - Thats nice, I'm a vegetarian.

When input comes into the system that matches "I like fish", it will return with the command "Thats nice, I'm a vegetarian.".
